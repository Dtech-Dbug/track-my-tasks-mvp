## Summary of the React Developer Task
First of all, let me start by saying how impressive and refreshing it is to see relevant challenges/tasks in tech screening that serves as a fair point understanding potential in a candidate. 
It was highly thoughtful to craft a task, that is simple, but uses core concepts in programming and and end to end integration.

## Challenges I faced
I will be honest, the greatest challenge I had was trying to get this done (in a day timeline) while having high fever and a severe sore throat.
Since I started a little late, I had to rush through the design stage and start off the functional requirements first, right after all the core features were implemented, did I get some time to refine the UI and make it look a little decent. My approach in solving this time bound constraint was - to find the core features, implement them first test and prototype (with a bare UI) 

One of the hardest challenges for me is to keep the files clean and try avoiding writing big lines of code, which is hard to follow. I solved this by having a specific file/folder structure, proper naming conventions with seperation of concerns, and a lot of modularity/reusability to avoid DRY code, as a result teh codebase is easy to follow and each file/feature is contained/moduled within themself.

## Things that can be improved if I had a little more time
- theme and style refining 
- optimization to prevent unnecessary renders
