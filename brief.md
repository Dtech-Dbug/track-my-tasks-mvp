## Summary of the React Developer Task
First of all, let me start by saying how impressive and refreshing it is to see relevant challenges/tasks in tech screening that serves as a fair point understanding potential in a candidate. 
It was highly thoughtful to craft a task, that is simple, but uses core concepts in programming and and end to end integration.

## Challenges I faced
I will be honest, the greatest challenge I had was trying to get this done (in a day timeline) while having high fever and a severe sore throat.

## Things that can be improved if I had a little more time
- theme and style refining 
- memoization/optimization to prevent unnecessary renders
